# Git Commit

Create atomic commits by staging the right files, analyzing the staged diff, composing a conventional commit message, and optionally pushing.

## Workflow

### 1) Pre-flight + context (single call)

Run all checks and context collection in one bash call:

```bash
git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree \
  && ! test -d "$(git rev-parse --git-dir)/rebase-merge" \
  && ! test -f "$(git rev-parse --git-dir)/MERGE_HEAD" \
  && ! test -f "$(git rev-parse --git-dir)/CHERRY_PICK_HEAD" \
  && git symbolic-ref HEAD \
  && git status --short --branch
```

If any check fails, stop with a clear error and suggested fix.

Arguments: `$ARGUMENTS`

### 2) Parse arguments

- Flags:
  - `--all` commit all changes
  - `--deep` deep analysis, breaking changes, concise body
  - `--push` push after commit
  - `--close <issue_numbers>` append `Closes #N` trailers for listed issues (comma/space-separated)
- Value arguments:
  - Type keyword (any conventional type) overrides inferred type
  - Quoted text overrides inferred description

### 3) Stage + read diff

- If `--all`:
  - If no changes at all: error "No changes to commit"
  - If unstaged changes exist: `git add -A`
  - If already staged: proceed
- Otherwise (atomic commits):
  - Session-modified files = files edited in this session
  - Currently staged files: `git diff --cached --name-only`
  - For staged files NOT in session-modified set: `git restore --staged <file>`
  - For session-modified files with changes: `git add <file>`
  - If none: error "No files modified in this session"
- **Unrelated changes**: session-modified files may contain pre-existing uncommitted changes (hunks not from this session). Include the entire file—partial staging is impractical. Never revert, discard, or `git checkout` unrelated changes.
- Read the staged diff once: `git diff --cached`
- Log staged files with status (A/M/D)

### 4) Analyze + compose message

Read the staged diff and produce the commit message in a single pass.

**Type inference** — determine from behavior:

| Behavior                                           | Type          |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| New functionality                                  | `feat`        |
| Bug fix / error handling                           | `fix`         |
| Code reorganization, no behavior change            | `refactor`    |
| Documentation                                      | `docs`        |
| Tests                                              | `test`        |
| Build system (webpack, vite, esbuild)              | `build`       |
| CI/CD pipelines                                    | `ci`          |
| Dependencies                                       | `chore(deps)` |
| Formatting / whitespace only                       | `style`       |
| Performance                                        | `perf`        |
| Reverting previous commit                          | `revert`      |
| AI config (CLAUDE.md, .claude/, .gemini/, .codex/) | `ai`          |
| Other maintenance                                  | `chore`       |

Explicit type keyword in arguments takes precedence over inference.

**Scope** — infer only when path makes it obvious (lowercase).

**Unrelated hunks** — ignore pre-existing changes when determining type/scope/description. If unrelated changes are in the same file as session changes, they are included in the commit scope but should not influence the message.

**Message format:**

- Subject line (\<= 50 chars): `type(scope): description` or `type: description`
- Imperative mood ("add" not "added"), lowercase, no period
- Describe what the change does, not which files changed
- Body: hyphenated lines for distinct changes; skip for trivial changes

**Issue linking** — scan the chat transcript for GitHub issue references (e.g. `#123`, `owner/repo#123`, issue URLs) that the current changes resolve. For each match, append a `Closes #N` trailer. Skip issues merely mentioned in passing; include only ones the commit actually closes.

**If `--deep`:**

- Deep semantic analysis; detect breaking changes
- Infer scope from code structure even when path isn't clear
- Body: 2-3 hyphenated lines max, focus on WHY
- Breaking change: `BREAKING CHANGE:` + one-line migration note

**If `--close`:**

- Append a `Closes #N` line for each issue number provided
- Multiple issues: one `Closes #N` per line in the body/trailer
- Merge with transcript-scanned issues; de-duplicate

### 5) Commit

- Use `git commit -m "subject"` (add `-m "body"` only if body is non-empty)
- Output: commit hash + subject + file count summary
- If failed: show error + suggest fix

### 6) Push (if `--push`)

- If upstream exists: `git push`
- If no upstream: `git push -u origin HEAD`
- If failed: show error + suggest fix (pull/rebase first, set upstream, check auth)
